Aim:
  To perform addition of two 8bit unsigned numbers using 8086.
Algorithm:
   1.move the data to a register (al register)
   2.move the data to yhe bl register (bl register)
   3.add the two register content
   4.terminate the program
Program:
   mov al,0004h
   mov bl,0004h
   add al,bl
   end
Result:
   thus,the program to add two 8-bit unsigned numbers was executed
